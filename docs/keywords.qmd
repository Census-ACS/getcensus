Users may use a keyword to retrieve a curated set of variables. 

```{r}

fn <- c(
  "When using the data retrieved by keyword <em>costburden_renters</em> to compute rates of renter housing cost burden, compute the denominator by subtracting the number of renters for whom cost burden is not computed (B25070_011) from the number of renters (B25070_001). This step is not necessary when using the data returned by keyword <em>housing_overview</em>; the total in this table's section on rent burden (DP04_0136) already excludes the number of renters for whom cost burden cannot be computed."
)

read_excel(
  "resources/doc_tables.xlsx", 
  sheet = "keywords"
) |>
  kable(
    table.attr = "data-quarto-disable-processing='true' class='table table-sm'"
  ) |>
  footnote(
    symbol = fn,
    escape = FALSE
  )

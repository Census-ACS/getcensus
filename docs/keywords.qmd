Users may use a keyword to retrieve a curated set of variables.

read_excel("resources/doc_tables.xlsx", sheet = "keywords") %>%

This step is not necessary when using the data returned by keyword <em>housing_overview</em>; the total in this table's section on rent burden (DP04_0136) already excludes the number of renters for whom cost burden cannot be computed."),
